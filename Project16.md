### Project 16 Automate Infrastructure With IAC using Terraform Part 1

**Objective:**: To create and delete AWS Network infrastructure programmatically using Terraform

Programmatic access was configured from the workstation to connect to AWS using the access keys created and a Python SDK (boto3) installed.

S3 bucket named was created on AWS to store Terraform state file and programmatic CLI access to AWS from the workstation was also confirmed by running **aws s3 ls** command

```bash
aws s3 ls
````

or from >python:
````bash
import boto3
s3 = boto3.resource('s3')
for bucket in s3.buckets.all():
    print(bucket.name)
````

#### Step 1: Create VPC and Subnets

Directory structure was created using Visual Studio Code by creating a folder named **PBL**. A file named **main.tf** was then created inside the PBL

AWS Provider and resource to create VPC was added to **main.tf** file created:

Plugin for AWS Provider was downloaded using **terraform init** command

**aws_vpc** resource was created using **terraform apply** after checking what terraform intends to create using **terraform plan** command

Resources to create Subnets (2 Public Subnets) in 2 Availability Zones was added to the **main.tf** file.

N.B: **vpc_id** argument was used to interpolate the value of the VPC id by setting it to **aws_vpc.main.id**. This way, Terraform knows inside which VPC to create the subnet.

The 2 public subnets were first created for a start with 2 resource blocks with hard coded values for the **availability_zone** and **cidr_block** and was confirmed successfully created on aws

N.B: Hardcoding values is not the best practice and so the code was then refactored to make it more dynamic

The infrastructure was destroyed by runnung **terraform destroy** command in order to begin the refactorng process

#### Step 2: Fixing Hard coding Problems By Code Refactoring

Variables and count arguments were introduced

Starting with the **provider block**, a **variable** named **region** was declared and given a **default value**. The **provider section** was then updated by making reference to the declared variable. Same was done to **cidr value** in the **vpc block**, and all the other arguments.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87030990/172060432-9a882989-75db-476e-bb77-0bb6616d7a12.png)

Multiple resource blocks was also fixed by introducing concept of Loops & Data sources to fetch information from AWS (outside of Terraform)
The code below was added to fetch Availability zones from AWS, and replace the hard coded value in the subnetâ€™s availability_zone section.

````bash
 # Get list of availability zones
        data "aws_availability_zones" "available" {
        state = "available"
        }
 ````
To make use of this new data resource, a count argument was introduced in the subnet block to tell terraform the number of resources to be created:
````bash
# Create public subnet
    resource "aws_subnet" "public" { 
        count                   = 2
        vpc_id                  = aws_vpc.main.id
        cidr_block              = "172.16.1.0/24"
        map_public_ip_on_launch = true
        availability_zone       = data.aws_availability_zones.available.names[count.index]

    }
 ````

To make the code more dynamic, **cidrsubnet(prefix, newbits, netnum)** function was introduced into the cidr block while the hardcoded count value was replaced with **length()** function (which basically determines the length of a given list, map, or string.)

````bash
# Create public subnet1
    resource "aws_subnet" "public" { 
        count                   = length(data.aws_availability_zones.available.names)
        vpc_id                  = aws_vpc.main.id
        cidr_block              = cidrsubnet(var.vpc_cidr, 8 , count.index)
        map_public_ip_on_launch = true
        availability_zone       = data.aws_availability_zones.available.names[count.index]

    }
````
A variable was declared to store the desired number of public subnets, and the default value set to 2 based on our design
````bash
variable "preferred_number_of_public_subnets" {
  default = 2
}
````
The count argument was updated with a condition for Terraform to check first if there is a desired number of subnets. If not to use the data returned by the lenght function

````bash
# Create public subnets
resource "aws_subnet" "public" {
  count  = var.preferred_number_of_public_subnets == null ? length(data.aws_availability_zones.available.names) : var.preferred_number_of_public_subnets   
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id
  cidr_block              = cidrsubnet(var.vpc_cidr, 8 , count.index)
  map_public_ip_on_launch = true
  availability_zone       = data.aws_availability_zones.available.names[count.index]

}
````

Running terraform plan give the output below

#### Step3: Introducing variables.tf & terraform.tfvars

**Variables.tf** and **terraform.tfvars** file were introduced and declared variables and defaults values copied into them respectively

terraform apply was run to create the vpc and the 2 public subnets after running terraform plan which was successful.

Conclusion: AWS Network infrastructure was successfully created and deleted programmatically using Terraform
