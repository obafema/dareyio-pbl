## Experience Continuous Integration with Jenkins | Ansible | Artifactory | Sonarqube | PHP

### Objective: To create a pipeline that simulates continuous integration and delivery for a PHP based application

### Step 1: Spin up an EC2 instance to serve as Jenkins_Ansible server and clone ansible-config-mgt repository from github on it.

#### An EC2 instance for installation of Jenkins and Ansible was spinned up and named P14_Jenkins_Ansible:

git was installed on the server

ansible-config-mgt repository from github was cloned to the Jenkins-Ansible server

### Step 2: Configuring Ansible For Jenkins Deployment

#### Before installing Jenkins on the server, Jenkins Redhat Packages and Jenkins dependencies (epel release, remirepository and Java) were installed on the EC2 instance serving as Jenkins_ansible server.

N.B: Jenkins requires Java to run, yet certain distributions do not include this by default.

#### wget, Jenkins Redhat Packages, epel release, remirepository and Java were installed on P14_Jenkins_Ansible EC2 instance
````bash
sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo\https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io.key
sudo yum upgrade
# Add required dependencies for the jenkins package
yum install -y https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm
yum install -y dnf-utils http://rpms.remirepo.net/enterprise/remi-release-8.rpm
sudo yum install java-11-openjdk
sudo yum install jenkins
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
````

#### bash profile was opened after installing java so that at any given time the instance is restarted this code is also export

#### Jenkins was then installed on the instance after installing the dependencies.

````bash
sudo yum install jenkins
````

#### Jenkinsfile was then created inside a new directory named deploy within the ansible project. 
#### Code snippet below was then added to start building the Jenkinsfile gradually. 
#### Code snippet below was then added to start building the Jenkinsfile gradually. 

````javascript

      steps {

#### Changes to deploy/Jenkinsfile were added, committed and pushed to GitHub.

````bash
git add .
git commit -m "add jenkinsfile"
git push
````
#### In the ansible-config-mgt pipelineâ€™s Build Configuration section in Jenkins, the location of the Jenkinsfile was specified:

#### The build job started automatically after applying and saving the script path

#### Note: To really appreciate and feel the difference of Cloud Blue UI, it is recommended to try triggering the build again from Blue Ocean interface.

#### Click on Blue Ocean, Select ansible-config-mgt project and Click on the play button against the branch
