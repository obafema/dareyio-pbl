### AWS CLOUD SOLUTION FOR 2 COMPANY WEBSITES USING A REVERSE PROXY TECHNOLOGY

**Objective:** To build an infrastructure that can serve 2 or more different websites that is resilient to Web Serverâ€™s failures, can accomodate increased traffic, at the lowest possible infrastructure and cloud cost while still satisfying high availability and security.

#### Step 1: Set up a Virtual Private Network (VPC) needed for the implementation

Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) was created

6 Subnets were created (2 Public and 4 Private Subnets) in 2 Availability Zones

Internet Gateway was created for accessibility by the public from the internet and attached to the VPC

Route table for public subnets was created and associated with the 2 public subnets. Route FOR Internet gateway was added to the routing table for public subnets

Route table for private subnet was created and associated with the 4 private subnets.

NAT Gateway was created in the public subnet and an Elastic IP allocated to it. Route for the NAT gateway was added to routing table for private subnets

#### To create Relational Database System

Prerequisite for creating RDS

KMS Key and RDS Subnet Group were created

#### Step 2: Set up Compute Resources inside the VPC

For a start a base imsge was chosen to help in building our own images (CentOS was chosen from AWS Market Place)

A base-ami from amazon market place was launched and used to create my images

Launch Templates were created for bastion, nginx, tooling webserver and wordpress webserver:

RDS Database was created



Database for tooling and wordpress named toolingdb and wordpressdb were created by login into the rds from the bastion server
