### AWS CLOUD SOLUTION FOR 2 COMPANY WEBSITES USING A REVERSE PROXY TECHNOLOGY

**Objective:** To build an infrastructure that can serve 2 or more different websites that is resilient to Web Serverâ€™s failures, can accomodate increased traffic, at the lowest possible infrastructure and cloud cost while still satisfying high availability and security.

#### Step 1: Set up a Virtual Private Network (VPC) needed for the implementation

Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) was created

6 Subnets were created (2 Public and 4 Private Subnets) in 2 Availability Zones

Internet Gateway was created for accessibility by the public from the internet and attached to the VPC

Route table for public subnets was created and associated with the 2 public subnets

Route table for private subnet was created and associated with the 4 private subnets

**Note:** We need 3 Elastic IPs for this implementation. 1 for the NAT Gateway and the other 2 for the Bastion server

NAT Gateway was created in the public subnet and an Elastic IP allocated to it

Security Group for External Public Facing Application Load Balancer, Nginx Servers, Bastion Servers, Internal Non Public Facing Application Load Balancer, Webservers and Data Layer were created

Create RDS

Prerequisite for creating RDS

1ST Create KMS Key

#### Step 2: Set up Compute Resources inside the VPC

For a start a base imsge was chosen to help in building our own images (CentOS was chosen from AWS Market Place)

A base-ami from amazon market place was launched and used to create my images

Launch Templates were created for bastion, nginx, tooling webserver and wordpress webserver:

External and Internal Load Balancers and the target groups were created

RDS Database was created

Database for tooling and wordpress named toolingd and wordpressdb were created by login into the rds from the bastion server

Auto Scaling Groups was created

In the Route 53, Records were created for tooling and wordpress Load Balancing
