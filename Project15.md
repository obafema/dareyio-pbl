### AWS CLOUD SOLUTION FOR 2 COMPANY WEBSITES USING A REVERSE PROXY TECHNOLOGY

**Objective:** To build an infrastructure that can serve 2 or more different websites that is resilient to Web Serverâ€™s failures, can accomodate increased traffic, at the lowest possible infrastructure and cloud cost while still satisfying high availability and security.

#### Step 1: Set up a Virtual Private Network (VPC) needed for the implementation

Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) was created

6 Subnets were created (2 Public and 4 Private Subnets) in 2 Availability Zones

Internet Gateway was created for accessibility by the public from the internet and attached to the VPC

Route table for public subnets was created and associated with the 2 public subnets. Route for Internet Gateway(igw) was added to the routing table for public subnets

Route table for private subnet was created and associated with the 4 private subnets.

NAT Gateway was created in the public subnet and an Elastic IP allocated to it. Route for the NAT gateway was added to routing table for private subnets

Security Group for External Public Facing Application Load Balancer, Nginx Servers, Bastion Servers, Internal Non Public Facing Application Load Balancer, Webservers and Data Layer were created

#### Step 2: Register a Domain and configure secured connection using SSL/TLS certificates

Domain (toolingobaf.ga) was used for the implimentation

TLS Certificates was configured for *.toolingobaf.ga

#### Step 3: Create the Data layer, which is comprised of Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) and Amazon Elastic File System (EFS)

EFS was created with access points for both tooling and wordpress

Prerequisite for creating Relational Database System (RDS)

KMS Key and RDS Subnet Group were created

RDS Database was then created

#### Step 4: Set up Compute Resources inside the VPC

For a start a base image was chosen from Amazon Market Place to help in building our own images

A base-ami(s) from amazon market place was launched and used to create my images

Launch Templates were created for bastion, nginx, tooling webserver and wordpress webserver:

External and Internal Load Balancers and the target groups were created

RDS Database was created



Auto Scaling Groups for Bastion and nginx were created
